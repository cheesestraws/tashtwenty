# TashTwenty Tiny

This is a dual PCB design, using mostly through hole components (with the exeption of the SD connector). It's designed this way to be period correct and easy to build for people who don't like soldering SMT components

This folder contains the source KiKad files for the main board. Please check the DB19_IDC20 subfolder for the DB19 to IDC20 adapter. 

### BOM (main board)
Here is the BOM for the main board. Part number are what was tested on prototypes board but you may find alternatives easily, especially resistors and sockets

Using sockets is recommended because it will allow you to reclaim the gates and microcontroler if your board is broken.
J1 is reserver for future use, you may want to use a wire for it. (or a resistor leg)

### Building

Building is straightworfard. It's recommended to start with the SD Card connector, then components, and headers + sockets last.
